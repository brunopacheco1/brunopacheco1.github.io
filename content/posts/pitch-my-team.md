Yesterday we had the "Pitch my team!" in Pictet Technologies, where we had 5 minutes to share what we've been doing in 2019. I wasn't excited about it when they asked us to do it, you know, me going to a stage, grabbing a mic a say something to hundred people.

But then Misi (our team lead) had a brilliant idea of recording a video using Prezi Video. With it, you can overlay the video camera output with the slides, allowing you to interact with the slides. We had funny couple of hours recording the video.

So, after more than 3 hours of presentations and voting, we were chosen for the best presentation! :) 

I was surprised a bit in the beginning. Twenty teams were competing, and many of them were perhaps more creative than us. But let's be honest, they voted on us.

So, I would like to register this moment in this blog. I am really happy of being part of this team!
