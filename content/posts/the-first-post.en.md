This is the first post in my personal blog. XD

Finally! It's been more than 10 years since I started working as a developer and no sharing. I think I am a bit late, but better now than never, right?

So, the idea here is just sharing my experiments with libs, languages, tools, Operating Systems, etc. Summing up, anything I think it may worth to share.

Especial thanks to [László](https://github.com/nerg4l) for pushing me to do that and showing this great tool, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)!
