      <description>After a chat with László, where I was asking some ideas to practice Quarkus and GraalVM, he suggested me to code the classic game Snake (AKA Worms by me :P).
First, why Quarkus? I&amp;rsquo;ve read an article somewhere and it was said that Quarkus is a great promising solution for the Java in the Cloud, as it reduces drastically the application&amp;rsquo;s footprint and it has an insanelly fast startup when running on native code, and here is where GraalVM enters.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in my personal blog. XD
Finally! It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 10 years since I started working as a developer and no sharing. I think I am a bit late, but better now than never, right?
So, the idea here is just sharing my experiments with libs, languages, tools, Operating Systems, etc. Summing up, anything I think it may worth to share.
Especial thanks to László for pushing me to do that and showing this great tool, Hugo!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m graduated in Computer Science and I have an MBA in Software Engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a software developer for more than 10 years already, mainly in Agile projects.
Most of my experience is related to Java (Spring and J2E), but I also have professional experience with PHP and JavaScript. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve played with R, Scala, Kotlin, Python and a bunch of different tools, in order to catch up with the trends and push myself.</description>
