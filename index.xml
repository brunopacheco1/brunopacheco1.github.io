      <description>This post is a follow-up to my previous article about Quarkus, Kotlin and GraalVM.
I was proud to have finished the Snake game, which was working in multiplayer mode. However, I wanted to improve the gaming experience by addressing two areas: the interface and scalability. I decided to focus on scalability, but unfortunately, I failed.
I have used Google Cloud Functions, Firebase, Firestore and Google Pub/Sub.
Motivation In the original project, I used VertX for in-memory PubSub to manage the game events.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we had the &amp;ldquo;Pitch my team!&amp;rdquo; in Pictet Technologies, where we had 5 minutes to share what we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing in 2019. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t excited about it when they asked us to do it, you know, me going to a stage, grabbing a mic a say something to hundred people.
But then Misi (our team lead) had a brilliant idea of recording a video using Prezi Video. With it, you can overlay the video camera output with the slides, allowing you to interact with the slides.</description>

      <description>During a chat with L치szl칩, I&amp;rsquo;ve asked him for some ideas to practice Quarkus and GraalVM, he suggested to code the classic game Snake (AKA Worms by me :P).
Motivations Why Quarkus? I&amp;rsquo;ve read an article saying that Quarkus is a great and promising solution for Java in the Cloud, as it drastically reduces the application&amp;rsquo;s footprint and has an insanely fast startup when running on native code.
GraalVM is a general-purpose VM for running applications written in a bunch of different languages, allowing a polyglot code.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in my personal blog. XD
Finally! It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 10 years since I started working as a developer and no sharing. I think I am a bit late, but better now than never, right?
So, the idea here is just sharing my experiments with libs, languages, tools, Operating Systems, etc. Summing up, anything I think it may worth to share.
Especial thanks to L치szl칩 for pushing me to do that and showing this great tool, Hugo!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m graduated in Computer Science and I have an MBA in Software Engineering by Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a software developer for more than 10 years already, mainly in Agile projects.
Most of my experience is related to Java (Spring and J2E), but I have also professional experience in PHP and JavaScript. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve played with R, Scala, Kotlin, Python and a bunch of different technologies, in order to catch up with the trends and push myself.</description>
