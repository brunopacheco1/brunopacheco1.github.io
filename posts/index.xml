      <description>During a chat with L치szl칩, I&amp;rsquo;ve asked him for some ideas to practice Quarkus and GraalVM, he suggested to code the classic game Snake (AKA Worms by me :P).
Motivations Why Quarkus? I&amp;rsquo;ve read an article saying that Quarkus is a great and promising solution for Java in the Cloud, as it drastically reduces the application&amp;rsquo;s footprint and has an insanely fast startup when running on native code.
GraalVM is a general-purpose VM for running applications written in a bunch of different languages, allowing a polyglot code.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in my personal blog. XD
Finally! It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 10 years since I started working as a developer and no sharing. I think I am a bit late, but better now than never, right?
So, the idea here is just sharing my experiments with libs, languages, tools, Operating Systems, etc. Summing up, anything I think it may worth to share.
Especial thanks to L치szl칩 for pushing me to do that and showing this great tool, Hugo!</description>
