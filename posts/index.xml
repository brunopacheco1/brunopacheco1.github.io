      <description>This is my first post in my personal blog. XD
Finally! It&amp;rsquo;s been more than 10 years since I started working as a developer and no sharing. I think I am a bit late, but better now than never, right?
So, the idea here is just sharing my experiments with libs, languages, tools, Operation Systems, etc. Summing up, anything I think it may worth to share.
Especial thanks to László for pushing me to do that and showing this great tool, Hugo!</description>
